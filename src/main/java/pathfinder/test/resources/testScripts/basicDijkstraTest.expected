# Basic Dijkstra on a simple graph
created graph sanity_check

added node A to sanity_check
added node B to sanity_check
added node C to sanity_check
added node D to sanity_check
added node E to sanity_check
added node F to sanity_check
added node G to sanity_check

added edge 2.000 from A to B in sanity_check
added edge 1.000 from A to C in sanity_check

added edge 5.000 from B to C in sanity_check
added edge 11.000 from B to D in sanity_check
added edge 3.000 from B to E in sanity_check

added edge 15.000 from C to G in sanity_check

added edge 2.000 from D to E in sanity_check

added edge 1.000 from E to C in sanity_check
added edge 4.000 from E to G in sanity_check
added edge 5.000 from E to F in sanity_check

added edge 1.000 from F to D in sanity_check
added edge 1.000 from F to G in sanity_check

path from A to F:
A to B with weight 2.000
B to E with weight 3.000
E to F with weight 5.000
total cost: 10.000
path from A to A:
total cost: 0.000
path from F to A:
no path found
